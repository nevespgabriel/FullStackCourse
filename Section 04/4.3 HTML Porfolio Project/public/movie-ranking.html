<h1>The Best Movies That Gabriel Has Ever Seen</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Favourite Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Joker</h3>
<p>Fucking social criticism. One of my favourite villains of all time, with a tragic history and sadistic personality.</p>
<h3>Toy Story 3</h3>
<p>It touched me when I was a child, and touches me everytime I remember it. The toys with human feelings at its finest</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>The best special effects I have ever seen, so exciting and emotional.</p>
